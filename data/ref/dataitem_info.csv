Write-off of intangibles or goodwill (categorized as Asset Writedown - (CF) [2069])
Accumulated amortization
Amortization of Negative Goodwill

Points:
1. Only before tax amortization values are considered for breakups.
2. The Cash flow /Income statement line items are not considered as a primary basis. The value shown is the exact amortization of goodwill, however, if the line item itself defines the pure depreciation of goodwill alone, then it can be categorized as amortization of goodwill.  
3. As per US GAAP (SFAS 142) goodwill relating to acquisitions before July 1, 2001, can be amortized up to December 31, 2001 and for acquisitions after June 30, 2001, there will be no amortization of goodwill in 2001 or thereafter. So for the US GAAP following companies, we will treat the amortization of goodwill as impairment of goodwill for the acquisitions after June 30, 2001.
4. As per IFRS, Amortization of acquired Goodwill is permitted up to March 31, 2004 only, because after the issue of IFRS 3 (BUSINESS COMBINATIONS) goodwill is no longer amortized but has to be tested for annual impairment. The effective date of implementation of IFRS 3 (BUSINESS COMBINATIONS) is January 4, 2004. So for the companies whose GAAP is IFRS, if the line item is given as amortization of goodwill we are treating it as impairment of goodwill from the financial years beginning on or after January 4, 2004.

Diluted Weighted Average Shares Outstanding is a line item across all templates and represents the number of diluted weighted average shares outstanding during the period (used by the reporting company as denominator in calculating Basic earnings per share/ADR equivalent). 
When not disclosed directly by the reporting company, Diluted Weighted Average Shares Outstanding is calculated using one of the following formulas or mapped from one of the following reported items depending on data availability in the particular period: 

(Diluted Net Income [3522] + Earnings Of Discontinued Operations [40] + Extraordinary Item & Accounting Change [42]) / Net EPS - Diluted (As Reported)
Diluted Net Income [3522] / Diluted EPS - Continuing Operations (As Reported)

Extraordinary Item & Accounting Change [42] / Diluted EPS - Extraordinary Items & Accounting Change [44]
Diluted Net Income [3522] / Net EPS - Diluted [8] 

For all calculated periods where reported Diluted WASO values are not available, Capital IQ calculates a weighted average count based on reported values for the component periods. For example, our LTM share count is calculated using the following formula: 

(12 * Annual WASO + Number of Months YTD * (WASO (YTD) - WASO (Prior YTD)) / 12 
For non-profitable calculated periods the formula above is replaced with a direct mapping from Basic Weighted Avg. Shares Outstanding [3217]

1070,Total Common Shares Outstanding,"Total Common Shares Outstanding [1070] item represents the total number of shares of a Company. If the company has only one class of shares i.e. either Common Shares or Class A Shares or Class B Shares, then that class of shares will be treated as total common shares outstanding  (CSO  Common Shares Outstanding    = Total Common Shares Outstanding; Class A Shares Outstanding = Total Common Shares Outstanding; Class B Shares Outstanding = Total Common Shares Outstanding).  If the company has more than one class of shares i.e. common shares, class A shares and class B shares then we are calculating total common shares outstanding in the following manner:
1. If the non trading class is convertible to trading class on a one-to-one basis, then they are simply added together.  (Total Common Shares Outstanding  =  Common Shares Outstanding + Class A Shares Outstanding + Class B Shares Outstanding).
2. If the non trading class is convertible to trading class on any other basis (i.e. where conversion factor is other than one) then the non trading class is converted to trading class by using the conversion factor given by the Company and showing the same as Total Common Shares outstanding.  Example: Company XYZ has 2 classes of shares i.e., Class A common Stock and Class B common stock. Class B common stock is convertible at a later date in the ratio of 2 shares of Class A common shares for every share of Class B common share. The company has 1,000 Class A common shares and 250 Class B common shares.   Therefore, Total Common Shares Outstanding = Class A Shares Outstanding + Class B Shares Outstanding * 2(conversion ratio).  In this case  Total Common Shares Outstanding = 1,000 + 250*2;  Total Common Shares Outstanding = 1,500

SOFD  Common Shares Outstanding On Filing Date     = TSOFD
SOFDA Class A Common Shares Outstanding On Filing Date = TSOFD
SOFDB  Class B Common Shares Outstanding On Filing Date = TSOFD

If the company has more than one class of shares i.e. common shares, class A shares, class B shares, then we are calculating total common shares outstanding on the filing date in the following manner.

1.If non trading class convertible to trading class on a one-to-one basis, they are added together.

*SOFD  Common Shares Outstanding On Filing Date     
*SOFDA Class A Common Shares Outstanding On Filing Date

TSOFD =  SOFD+SOFDA+SOFDB

2.If non trading class convertible to trading class on any other basis (i.e. where conversion factor is other than one), we are converting non trading class to trading class by using conversion factor given by the Company and showing  same as Total Common Shares Outstanding on Filing Date

For example:

Company XYZ has 2 classes of shares on filing date  i.e., Class A common Stock and Class B common stock. Class B common stock is convertible at a later date in the ratio of 2 shares of Class A common shares for every share of Class B common share. The company has 1,000 Class A common shares and 250 Class B common shares. 

SOFDA Class A Common Shares Outstanding On Filing Date 
SOFDB  Class B Common Shares Outstanding On Filing Date
TSOFD = SOFDA+SOFDB*2(conversion ratio)

In the above case
TSOFD = 1,000+250*2
TSOFD = 1,500

Net Income - (CF) [2150] is a line item across all templates that represents opening line of the operating activities section of the Cash Flow Statement. Most companies present a Cash Flow Statement that reconciles Cash Flow from Operations to Net Income as reported on the Income Statement. In some cases, however, companies choose a different format for the operating activities section. In such cases, Capital IQ will use Net Income from the Income Statement [15] as the opening line of the Cash Flow Statement and will calculate the difference between Net Income on the Income Statement [15] and the opening line of the operating activities section as originally reported by the company. The difference is mapped to Other Operating Activities, Total [2047] as Adjustments to Cash Flow Net Income [21523]"

Float (%) [4170] represents the percentage of common shares outstanding that are freely available for public trading. Float (%) [4170] excludes holdings of insiders, such as officers and directors, and strategic 5% shareholders, such as private equity or venture capital investors.

Shares held by insiders data is mainly coming from annual reports and proxy statements. These are DEF14A or 10-Ks in the US and annual reports outside the US. These documents are annual, so by its nature, the predominant chunk of insider ownership is going to be updated annually. Insiders can also file notifications (13D/G in US, international notifications like exchange announcements elsewhere). These typically need to be filed when an entity crosses a certain percentage of ownership, usually 5%. 

Strategic 5% shareholders: If a principal investing firm, typically a private equity or a venture capital firm, owns more than 5% of a company, it will be considered a strategic shareholder.  On the other hand mutual fund managers can freely trade out of any position and their holdings are therefore not excluded from the float share count

Other strategic holders include: 
5% owners who are individuals but not officers or directors of a company.
Corporations (ex. Time Warner investment in TiVo)
Company controlled foundations (ex. Lilly Endowment Inc investment in Eli Lilly)

Last close Market capitalization is the aggregate valuation of the company based on its last close share price and the last close number of outstanding stocks. It is calculated by multiplying the last close market price of the company share with the last close outstanding shares of the company.

For companies with multiple class, the calculation is done at the security/class level and then aggregated for a company level market cap

Last Close Market Capitalization is calculated using the following formula: Last Close BS Shares out [100053] * Last Close Price [100052]
